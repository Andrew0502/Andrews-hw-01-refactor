# Andrews-hw-01-refactor

## Description 

This repository is where I have refactored a webpage for Horiseon Social Solution Services, Inc. I did this to improve and practice my coding skills. I found the code in a functional, but less perfect state. I replaced the generic <div> tags with the approriate semantic html tags, condensed the CSS tags and improved accessibility with alt attributes on images.

## Credits

I would like to thank my classmates who showed my tips and tricks of the trade.

Badges aren't _necessary_, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.
