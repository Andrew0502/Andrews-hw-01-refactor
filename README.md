# Andrews-hw-01-refactor

## Description 

This repository is where I have refactored a webpage for Horiseon Social Solution Services, Inc. I did this to improve and practice my coding skills. I found the code in a functional, but less perfect state. I replaced the generic <div> tags with the approriate semantic html tags, condensed the CSS tags and improved accessibility with alt attributes on images.
